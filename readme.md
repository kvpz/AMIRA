# AMIRA Robot Vision and Control System

A task in the task scheduler is designed to perform the following:
1. Read the current state of the state machine.
2. Determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and any inputs.
3. Perform any necessary actions associated with the current state, such as reading sensors, controlling actuators, or communicating with other systems.
4. Update any internal state variables used by the state machine or other tasks.
5. Request any additional tasks to be executed based on the current state.
